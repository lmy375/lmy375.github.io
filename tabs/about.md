A security researcher and web3 developer.

<!-- Starting from my student days, I dabbled in hacking, becoming a script kiddie, conducting numerous `penetration tests`, and gaining access to some small websites, in a non-malicious way, of course.

Later, I delved into software `reverse engineering` and binary exploitation techniques. During this time, I conducted an in-depth study of VMProtect, a renowned software protection tool.

In college, I founded a not-so-famous CTF team called [Lancet](https://ctftime.org/team/20556), participating in many CTF contests and tackling Re/Pwn/Web challenges most.

I then served as a security researcher in a well-known security lab, primarily focusing on `binary vulnerability hunting and exploiting` of Javascript engines in browser. I discovered dozens of RCE vulnerabilities and was ranked 12th in [MSRCâ€™s 2018-2019 Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc.microsoft.com/blog/2019/08/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/).

Eventually, my interest in vulnerability mining waned - it was too hard and increasingly dull. By a stroke of luck, I began researching `blockchain technology and web3 security`. Now, I'm not just a security researcher, but also a web3 builder, or maybe `buidler` in a more web3 way :)

I wrote [technical articles](/posts/2024-01-01-past-blogs) a lot, not out of a love for writing, but out of fear of forgetting. Now, I'm sharing them with you, in the hope that they might be of some help. -->
